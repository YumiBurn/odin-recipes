 <h3> <u> What do i actually need to make tacos? </u></h3>

 <ul>
    <li> Sour cream </li>
    <li> Beef broth</li>
    <li> lettuce </li>
    <li> Cheese </li>
    <li> Pico de gallo</li>
    <li> Ground beef</li>
</ul>

<h3> <u> What steps do i take to create tacos? </u> </h3>
<ol> 
<li> Brown the Beef: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. <br>  Add the ground beef and cook for 7-10 minutes, breaking it into small crumbles with a wooden spoon, <br> until it is browned throughout.</li>
<br>
<li> Drain the Grease: Place a colander over a heatproof bowl or in the sink  <br> and pour the beef into it to remove excess fat. <br> Return the beef to the skillet. </li> <br>

<li> Season and Simmer: Stir the taco seasoning and tomato sauce (or water) into the meat. <br> Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 5-10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken.</li> <br>

<li> Heat the Shells: While the meat simmers, place hard shells on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 5 minutes, <br> or heat soft tortillas in a dry pan until warm and pliable. </li>
<br>
<li> Assemble the Tacos: Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of meat into each shell. <br> Top with cheese (so it melts on the warm meat), followed by lettuce, tomatoes, and other toppings.  </li>
